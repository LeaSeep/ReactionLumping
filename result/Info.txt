Here is the data saved, which are needed for Figure 2 and 3 for the paper.
No results are provided here, as the timings do differ between different machines.
The new lumped model is not explicit saved, please change the main.m fundtion within
program if you want to save the model. 
Note that it was designed as a function to work in line with existing TMFA-framework, hence
to be directly handed over.
