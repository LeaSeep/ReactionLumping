Note: Here will be the data saved, which is needed for Figure 2 and 3 for the paper, if within the main function section "lumpingprocedure_timing.m" was done.
No results are provided here, as the timings do differ between different machines.
The new lumped model is not explicit saved, please change the main.m fundtion within program if you want to save the model. 
Note that it was designed as a function to work in line with existing TMFA-framework, hence
to be directly handed over.
